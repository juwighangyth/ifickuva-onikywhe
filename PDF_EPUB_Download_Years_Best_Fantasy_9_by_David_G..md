Overview
Twenty-eight doses of wonder, including contributions by Naomi Novik, Catherynne M. Valente, Elizabeth Bear, and Jeffrey Ford.
 
 From the distant past to the present day, from Antarctica and Mars to worlds that never were, the tales in this book bring news from nowhere-and everywhere. Fantasy is a mode of storytelling, a method of entertainment, a mode of argument, and a way of seeing. Here, presented by two of the most distinguished anthologists of the day, are twenty-eight stories that see, tell, argue, and entertain.
 
 Includes contributions from Elizabeth Bear, Peter S. Beagle, Kage Baker, Daryl Gregory, Lisa Goldstein, Al Michaud, Naomi Novik, Catherynne M. Valente, John Brown, Richard Bowes, Kij Johnson, Debra Doyle and James Macdonald, Geoff Ryman, Marc Laidlaw, Liz Williams, James Morrow, Kris Dikeman [as Kristine Dikeman], Randy McCharles, Kage Baker, Richard Parks, Peter S. Beagle, Richard Harland, Howard Waldrop, Delia Sherman, James Stoddard, Stephen Woodworth, Jeffrey Ford, and Kim Wilkins.
