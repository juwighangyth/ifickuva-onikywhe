Overview
A fast-paced, hilarious, and ultimately hopeful novel for anyone who has ever worried they might be a terrible personâ€”from the bestselling author of Everyone in This Room Will Someday Be Dead.
 
 Enid is obsessed with space. She can tell you all about black holes and their ability to spaghettify you without batting an eye in fear. Her one major phobia? Bald men. But she tries to keep that one under wraps. When sheâ€™s not listening to her favorite true crime podcasts on a loop, sheâ€™s serially dating a rotation of women from dating apps. At the same time, sheâ€™s trying to forge a new relationship with her estranged half-sisters after the death of her absent father. When she unwittingly plunges into her first serious romantic entanglement, Enid starts to believe that someone is following her.
 
 As her paranoia spirals out of control, Enid must contend with her mounting suspicion that something is seriously wrong with her. Because at the end of the day thereâ€™s only one person she canâ€™t outrunâ€”herself.
 
 Brimming with quirky humor, charm, and heart, Interesting Facts about Space effortlessly shows us the power of revealing our secret shames, the most beautifully human parts of us all.
