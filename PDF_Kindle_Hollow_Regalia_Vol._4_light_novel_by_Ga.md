Overview
Yahiro and the gang head to Kyoto hoping to figure out how to turn the Japanese populace back into humans. When Galerie Berithâ€™s armored train stops in Nagoya, the Chinese Federal Army, the current occupant of the former Nagoya Station, demands that the Galerie surrender Vanagloriaâ€™s Regalia in exchange for safe passage. By that time, the powerful Relict has fused with Ayaho, and handing over one of Irohaâ€™s siblings is the last thing theyâ€™d do. Can they protect her, negotiate their way out of the situation, and defend against a herd of Moujuu all at once?
