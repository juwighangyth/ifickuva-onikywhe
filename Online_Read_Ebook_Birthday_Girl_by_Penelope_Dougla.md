Overview
True love comes from the most forbidden places in this TikTok smash hit from New York Times bestselling author Penelope Douglas, now with bonus material!

 Jordan has nowhere else to go when her boyfriend offers to let her move in with him and his dad. Working a dead-end job, with her relationship sputtering, she jumps at the opportunity, expecting to help out around the house in exchange. Â What she doesnâ€™t anticipate is for her heart to race every time Pike pulls into the driveway, or to burn when their eyes meet over the breakfast table. Heâ€™s kind and listens to her and protects her in a way no man ever has before. Her sister once told her there are no good men, and if you find one, he&#039;s probably unavailable. Only Pike isn&#039;t the unavailable oneâ€¦she is.

 As the days go by, Pikeâ€™s finding it anything but simple to have his sonâ€™s girlfriend living in his house. He canâ€™t stop thinking about her and holding his breath every time they cross paths. It feels like sheâ€™s becoming a part of him. Except he knows theyâ€™re not free to give in to this. How could they when heâ€™s her boyfriendâ€™s father?
